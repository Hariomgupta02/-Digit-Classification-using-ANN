MNIST DatasetÂ¶
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. This dataset is considered to be the "hello world" dataset for Computer Vision.
It has a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples for handwritten digits with a fixed dimension of 28X28 pixels. The goal is to correctly identify digits and find ways to improve the performance of the model. So let's dive into it
